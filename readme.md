<img width="1517" height="613" alt="framework10" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2f93d35-5f9e-42c0-8ad0-f54157ee27a9" />

A Python-based simulator that models **User Equipment (UEs)** — cars — moving through a real city with real **Base Station Towers** fetched from OpenCellID. The simulator calculates real-time **RSRP** and **RSRQ** signal metrics using standard radio propagation models and compares three handover strategies: the **3GPP A3 baseline**, a **trained Double DQN agent**, and a **confidence-gated DDQN with Conditional Handover (CHO)** for optimized handover decisions in 5G networks.

---

## What is Handover?

In mobile networks, as a car moves through a city, it constantly measures signal strength from nearby base stations. When a neighboring BS provides a stronger signal than the current serving BS, the network triggers a **handover** — switching the UE's connection to the better tower.

This simulator models that process from first principles using real map data, real tower locations, and realistic vehicle movement.

---

## Features

- **Real city maps** — downloads street maps from OpenStreetMap via Overpass API, cached locally to avoid redundant downloads
- **Real tower data** — downloads the full OpenCellID CSV database per MCC, filters LTE/NR towers within the simulation bbox, cached locally to avoid redundant downloads
- **Realistic vehicle movement** — uses SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility) to generate traffic on actual streets
- **3GPP-compliant signal model** — log-distance path loss, shadow fading (Gudmundson), fast fading (Rician/Rayleigh), RSRP, RSRQ, thermal noise
- **3GPP A3 handover logic** — hysteresis-based handover decisions (2 dB margin) with Time-to-Trigger (TTT)
- **Multi-UE support** — simulate multiple cars simultaneously
- **Interactive map output** — Folium HTML visualization, auto-opened in browser
- **TensorBoard logging** — per-UE and system-level metrics (RSRP, RSRQ, handovers, ping-pongs, RLF, handover delay) with auto-launch support
- **DDQN training pipeline** — Gymnasium environment, Double DQN agent, experience replay, checkpointing, GPU support
- **Confidence-gated CHO** — DDQN with softmax confidence thresholding and direction-aware cosine similarity fallback
- **Multi-seed evaluation** — automated comparison of all three algorithms across 10+ random seeds with aggregated performance metrics
- **Visualization pipeline** — Matplotlib/Seaborn chart generation from TensorBoard data (training curves, performance bars, RSRP distributions, statistical plots)

## Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

**Python dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility):**
- Download and install from [sumo.dlr.de](https://sumo.dlr.de/)
- Set the `SUMO_HOME` environment variable to your SUMO installation path

**OpenCellID API key:**
- Register at [opencellid.org](https://opencellid.org/) to get a free API key
- Create a `.env` file in the project root:
  ```
  OPEN_CELL_ID_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
  ```

### 2. Prepare Data

```bash
python prepare.py
```

This will:
1. Download the OSM street map for the configured area → cached to `cache/maps/` (skipped if bbox matches)
2. Download the full OpenCellID CSV database for the configured MCC, then filter LTE/NR towers within the bbox → cached to `cache/towers/` (skipped if bbox matches)
3. Generate vehicle traffic using SUMO (netconvert → randomTrips → duarouter → simulation)

### 3. Train DDQN Agent

```bash
python -m rl.ddqn_agent
```

This will:
1. Initialize the Gymnasium handover environment (generates new SUMO traffic each episode)
2. Train a Double DQN agent with epsilon-greedy exploration
3. Log training metrics (reward, loss, Q-values, handovers, ping-pongs) to TensorBoard
4. Save checkpoints to `cache/training/` after each episode
5. Export the final model to `outputs/final_ddqn_model.pth`

Set `USE_GPU = True` (default) in `rl/ddqn_agent.py` to train on CUDA if available, or `False` to force CPU.

> **Note:** The replay buffer (`cache/training/replay_buffer.pkl`) and checkpoint (`cache/training/ddqn_checkpoint.pth`) persist across runs for seamless resume. If you change the environment config (map, towers, observation shape), delete `cache/training/` before retraining to avoid stale data.

### 4. Run Simulation & Evaluation

```bash
python test.py
```

This will:
1. Load base stations from cached tower data
2. Parse SUMO FCD traces for vehicle positions
3. Run the 3GPP A3 RSRP baseline simulation (if `TEST_A3_RSRP = True`) with all UEs
4. Run the DDQN-CHO handover simulation (if `TEST_DDQN = True`, requires a trained model at `outputs/final_ddqn_model.pth`) with all UEs
5. Log per-UE and system-level metrics (RSRP, RSRQ, handovers, ping-pongs, RLF, handover delay) to TensorBoard
6. Render an interactive map to `outputs/folium/simulation.html`
7. Auto-launch TensorBoard for side-by-side comparison of A3 vs DDQN-CHO runs

### 5. Multi-Seed Evaluation

```bash
python test_rsrp.py
```

Runs all three algorithms (A3_RSRP, DDQN, DDQN_CHO) on a single UE across 10 seeds (900s each), with:
- Per-seed per-algorithm TensorBoard logs
- Running-average PERF logs for convergence tracking
- Aggregated summary table (handovers, ping-pongs, ping-pong rate, RLF, DHO)
- Average RSRP per timestep across seeds

```bash
python test_rsrp_cumulative.py
```

Same as `test_rsrp.py` but logs **cumulative RSRP** (running sum) per timestep instead of instantaneous values. Also re-logs training reward and loss data for unified TensorBoard visualization.

```bash
python test_cho.py
```

CHO confidence threshold sweep — tests DDQN_CHO with multiple `confidence_threshold` values (0.55–0.75) against a pure DDQN baseline across 5 seeds. Reports the optimal threshold that minimizes ping-pong rate.

### 6. Generate Plots

```bash
python plotter/plotter.py
```

Extracts data from TensorBoard event files and generates:
- **Training curves** — reward, loss, and epsilon over episodes
- **Performance bar charts** — average and total handovers/ping-pongs per algorithm
- **Ping-pong rate comparison** — per-algorithm reduction vs A3 baseline
- **RSRP distribution plots** — KDE, violin, box, raincloud, EMA, raw, FFT, and statistical bar charts

Output CSVs are saved to `plotter/csv/` and PNG charts to `plotter/`.

---

## Handover Algorithms

### A3_RSRP_3GPP — 3GPP A3 Event

The standard 3GPP A3 event triggers a handover when:

```
RSRP(neighbor) > RSRP(serving) + hysteresis
```

- Comparison is done in **dBm** for fair inter-RAT evaluation (LTE/NR)
- Default hysteresis: **2 dB**
- Time-to-Trigger (TTT): **160 ms** — condition must hold across the last `ceil(TTT / dt) + 1` reports
- Initial connection: UE automatically attaches to the strongest available tower

### DDQN — Pure Double DQN

Top-4 tower filtering → build observation state → argmax Q-value → handover if target differs from serving tower.

No post-processing or direction awareness — the agent's Q-value ranking is trusted directly.

### DDQN_CHO — Confidence-Gated Conditional Handover

A two-stage decision process that combines DDQN with direction-aware scoring:

1. **Top-4 filtering** — select the 4 strongest towers by normalized RSRP (serving tower guaranteed a slot)
2. **Build observation** — 14-feature state vector (see [Observation Space](#observation-space))
3. **DDQN forward pass** — compute Q-values for all 4 candidate towers
4. **Confidence gate** — compute softmax over the top-2 Q-values:
   - If `softmax(Q_best) >= confidence_threshold` (default 0.55): **trust DDQN** and handover to its pick
   - If below threshold: **DDQN is uncertain** — fall back to weighted scoring
5. **Weighted fallback** — for the top-2 candidates, compute:
   - `similarity` = cosine similarity between UE heading and bearing to tower (normalized to [0, 1])
   - `score = similarity_weight * similarity + q_weight * softmax_Q`
   - Where `q_weight = clamp(Q_gap, 0, 1)` and `similarity_weight = 1 - q_weight`
   - The candidate with the higher score wins

This design lets the agent make fast decisions when confident, and only invokes the more expensive direction-aware tiebreaker when the Q-values are ambiguous.

### NONE — No Handover

UE stays on its initial tower for the entire simulation. Used internally by the training environment (the RL agent controls handovers directly via actions).

### Summary

| Algorithm | Description |
|---|---|
| `A3_RSRP_3GPP` | Standard 3GPP A3 event with hysteresis and TTT |
| `DDQN` | Pure DDQN (argmax Q-values, no post-processing) |
| `DDQN_CHO` | Confidence-gated DDQN with direction-aware cosine similarity fallback |
| `NONE` | No handover (stay on initial tower) |

---

## Radio Link Failure (RLF) Detection

A simplified RSRP-based proxy for the 3GPP Qout mechanism. In the standard (TS 38.133 Section 8.1.1 for NR, TS 36.133 Section 7.6 for LTE), Qout is defined as 10% BLER of a hypothetical PDCCH — an SINR/BLER threshold, not RSRP. This simulator uses a per-RAT normalized RSRP threshold mapped to approximately **-116 dBm** as a practical cell-edge proxy:

| RAT | Normalized Threshold | RSRP Equivalent |
|---|---|---|
| NR | `41/127 = 0.323` | ~ -116 dBm |
| LTE | `25/97 = 0.258` | ~ -116 dBm |

When the serving cell RSRP falls below the threshold, the UE enters an RLF state. The RLF counter increments once per entry (not per timestep while below threshold) — it clears when RSRP recovers above the threshold.

## Handover Interruption Time (DHO)

Each handover adds a fixed interruption delay to the UE's accumulated handover delay cost (`dho_time`), based on 3GPP intra-frequency known-cell requirements:

| RAT | Interruption Time | Source |
|---|---|---|
| NR | 20 ms | TS 38.133 Section 8.2.2 |
| LTE | 40 ms | TS 36.133 Section 8.1.1.1 |

## Ping-Pong Detection

A ping-pong handover is detected when the pattern A -> B -> A occurs in the connection history and the time spent on tower B is less than `min_time_of_stay` (1.0 s):

```
BS_A (t1) -> BS_B (t2) -> BS_A (t3)
where A != B and (t3 - t2) < 1.0 s
```

---

## Reinforcement Learning

### QNetwork Architecture

The neural network is a simple feedforward MLP:

```
Input (14) -> Linear(256) -> GELU -> Linear(128) -> GELU -> Linear(64) -> GELU -> Linear(4) -> Q-values
```

- Hard target-network updates (full weight copy)
- `from_state_dict` factory for loading trained models

### Observation Space

The environment produces a 14-dimensional observation vector:

| Features | Count | Range | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Normalized RSRP | 4 | [0, 1] | RSRP index / max_index for each top-4 tower |
| RSRP trend | 4 | [-1, 1] | Delta between current and previous normalized RSRP per tower |
| Serving one-hot | 4 | {0, 1} | Which of the 4 towers is currently serving |
| Normalized speed | 1 | [0, 1] | UE speed / 30 m/s (clamped) |
| Time since handover | 1 | [0, 1] | Normalized cooldown: 0 = just switched, 1 = fully cooled down |

### Action Space

`Discrete(4)` — choose one of the top-4 candidate base stations. If the chosen tower is already the serving tower, no handover occurs.

### Reward Design

The reward uses a **counterfactual delta** framework — signals from the old and new tower are compared at the same physical position using the latest measurement report:

| Scenario | Reward |
|---|---|
| Handover executed | `rsrp(new_tower) - rsrp(old_tower) - dynamic_penalty` |
| Stay (no handover) | `rsrp(serving) - rsrp(best_alternative)` — positive if serving is stronger, negative if a better option exists |
| RLF penalty | `-1.5` applied on top of any reward when serving RSRP falls below the RLF threshold |

The "stay" reward uses a **counterfactual comparison**: the agent is rewarded for staying on a strong tower and penalized for ignoring a better alternative. Combined with the handover penalty, this creates a learned hysteresis that balances signal quality against switching cost.

#### Dynamic Handover Penalty (Cooldown)

The handover penalty scales based on time since the last handover, penalizing rapid switching more heavily:

```
penalty = cooldown_penalty * (1 - time_since_ho)
```

Where `time_since_ho` is normalized to `[0, 1]` based on `min_time_of_stay`.

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `cooldown_penalty` | `0.5` | Maximum penalty (decays with time since last handover) |
| `min_time_of_stay` | `1.0 s` | Cooldown period before penalty reaches zero |

This produces a penalty range of `0.0` (fully cooled down) to `0.5` (immediate re-switch), directly discouraging ping-pong handovers while allowing justified handovers after the cooldown.

### Training Pipeline

- **Gymnasium Environment** (`rl/handover_env.py`) — generates new SUMO traffic each episode, resets fading state, single-agent (UE 0) with `HandoverAlgorithm.NONE` (agent controls handovers via actions). Retries if agent has fewer than 10 timesteps.
- **DDQN Agent** (`rl/ddqn_agent.py`) — Double DQN with epsilon-greedy exploration, Huber loss (SmoothL1), Adam optimizer, hard target network updates every 2 episodes
- **Replay Buffer** (`rl/replay_buffer.py`) — deque-based with `maxlen=50000`, pickle persistence to disk
- **Checkpoint Manager** (`rl/checkpoint_manager.py`) — saves/resumes training state (episode, epsilon, policy/target networks, optimizer) with cross-device support

### Training Outputs

| Output | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Final model | `outputs/final_ddqn_model.pth` | Exported policy network state dict |
| Checkpoint | `cache/training/ddqn_checkpoint.pth` | Full training state for resume |
| Replay buffer | `cache/training/replay_buffer.pkl` | Persisted experience buffer |

## System-Level Abstraction Notes

This simulation is a **system-level abstraction** of the 5G NR physical layer, not a full PHY emulator. Key simplifying assumptions:

| Aspect | 3GPP Reality | Our Abstraction | Justification |
|---|---|---|---|
| **LOS/NLOS** | Probability function based on distance | Hard 5 m cutoff | Simulates dense urban canyon where UEs are almost always NLOS |
| **Antennas** | Massive MIMO with active beamforming | Static isotropic gain (`G_tx`) | Isolates handover algorithm evaluation from beam-tracking mechanics |
| **Path Loss** | Dual-slope model with breakpoint distances | Standard log-distance model | Widely accepted balance of realism and computational efficiency for RL |
| **RLF detection** | SINR/BLER-based Qout with T310/N310/N311 timers | Single RSRP threshold per-RAT (~ -116 dBm) | Captures cell-edge failure events without full L1/RRC timer state machine |
| **Handover delay** | Variable interruption (search, SI acquisition, RACH) | Fixed per-RAT (NR: 20 ms, LTE: 40 ms) | Matches 3GPP intra-freq known-cell baseline from TS 38.133/36.133 |
