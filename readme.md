# 5G Handover DDQN — Learned Handover Optimization vs 3GPP A3 Baseline

A Python-based simulator that models **User Equipment (UEs)** — cars — moving through a real city with real **Base Station Towers** fetched from OpenCellID. The simulator calculates real-time **RSRP** and **RSRQ** signal metrics using standard radio propagation models, implementing 3GPP A3 handover decision logic. Designed as a foundation for **AI / Reinforcement Learning** agents to optimize handover decisions in 5G networks.

---

## What is Handover?

In mobile networks, as a car moves through a city, it constantly measures signal strength from nearby base stations. When a neighboring BS provides a stronger signal than the current serving BS, the network triggers a **handover** — switching the UE's connection to the better tower.

This simulator models that process from first principles using real map data, real tower locations, and realistic vehicle movement.

---

## Features

- **Real city maps** — downloads street maps from OpenStreetMap via Overpass API, cached locally to avoid redundant downloads
- **Real tower data** — downloads the full OpenCellID CSV database per MCC, filters LTE/NR towers within the simulation bbox, cached locally to avoid redundant downloads
- **Realistic vehicle movement** — uses SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility) to generate traffic on actual streets
- **3GPP-compliant signal model** — log-distance path loss, shadow fading (Gudmundson), fast fading (Rician/Rayleigh), RSRP, RSRQ, thermal noise
- **3GPP A3 handover logic** — hysteresis-based handover decisions (2 dB margin) with Time-to-Trigger (TTT)
- **Multi-UE support** — simulate multiple cars simultaneously
- **Interactive map output** — Folium HTML visualization, auto-opened in browser
- **TensorBoard logging** — per-UE and system-level metrics (RSRP, RSRQ, handovers, ping-pongs, RLF, handover delay) with auto-launch support
- **DDQN training pipeline** — Gymnasium environment, Double DQN agent, experience replay, checkpointing, GPU support

## Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

**Python dependencies:**
```bash
pip install numpy folium requests python-dotenv colorama torch gymnasium tensorboard
```

**SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility):**
- Download and install from [sumo.dlr.de](https://sumo.dlr.de/)
- Set the `SUMO_HOME` environment variable to your SUMO installation path

**OpenCellID API key:**
- Register at [opencellid.org](https://opencellid.org/) to get a free API key
- Create a `.env` file in the project root:
  ```
  OPEN_CELL_ID_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
  ```

### 2. Prepare Data

```bash
python prepare.py
```

This will:
1. Download the OSM street map for the configured area → cached to `cache/maps/` (skipped if bbox matches)
2. Download the full OpenCellID CSV database for the configured MCC, then filter LTE/NR towers within the bbox → cached to `cache/towers/` (skipped if bbox matches)
3. Generate vehicle traffic using SUMO (netconvert → randomTrips → duarouter → simulation)

### 3. Run Simulation & Evaluation

```bash
python test.py
```

This will:
1. Load base stations from cached tower data
2. Parse SUMO FCD traces for vehicle positions
3. Run the 3GPP A3 RSRP baseline simulation (if `TEST_A3_RSRP = True`)
4. Run the DDQN handover simulation (if `TEST_DDQN = True`, requires a trained model at `outputs/final_ddqn_model.pth`)
5. Log per-UE and system-level metrics (RSRP, RSRQ, handovers, ping-pongs, averages) to TensorBoard
6. Render an interactive map to `outputs/folium/simulation.html`
7. Auto-launch TensorBoard for side-by-side comparison of A3 vs DDQN runs

### 4. Train DDQN Agent

```bash
python -m rl.ddqn_agent
```

This will:
1. Initialize the Gymnasium handover environment (generates new SUMO traffic each episode)
2. Train a Double DQN agent with epsilon-greedy exploration
3. Log training metrics (reward, loss, Q-values, handovers, ping-pongs) to TensorBoard
4. Save checkpoints to `cache/training/` after each epoch
5. Export the final model to `outputs/final_ddqn_model.pth`

Set `USE_GPU = True` (default) in `rl/ddqn_agent.py` to train on CUDA if available, or `False` to force CPU.

> **Note:** The replay buffer (`cache/training/replay_buffer.pkl`) and checkpoint (`cache/training/ddqn_checkpoint.pth`) persist across runs for seamless resume. If you change the environment config (map, towers, observation shape), delete `cache/training/` before retraining to avoid stale data.

## Signal Model

### Path Loss (Log-Distance)

```
PL(d) = PL(d0) + 10·n·log10(d/d0)
```

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `d0` | 1 m | Reference distance |
| `n` (LOS) | 2.0 | Path loss exponent — clear line of sight |
| `n` (NLOS) | 3.5 | Path loss exponent — dense urban obstructions (Rappaport range 2.7–3.5) |
| LOS threshold | 5 m | Distance under which LOS is assumed |

### RSRP

```
RSRP (dBm) = P_tx + G_tx + G_rx - PL(d) - L_shadow + L_fast
```

| Parameter | LTE | NR | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `P_tx` | 46 dBm (40W) | 43 dBm (20W) | BS transmit power (3GPP TS 36.104 / 38.104) |
| `G_tx` | 15 dBi | 17 dBi | BS antenna gain (MIMO beamforming for NR) |
| `G_rx` | 0 dBi | 0 dBi | UE omnidirectional antenna gain |
| Frequency | 1800 MHz (Band 3) | 3500 MHz (n78) | Carrier frequency |

### Shadow Fading (Gudmundson Model)

Spatially correlated log-normal fading per link:

```
S_new = r · S_old + sqrt(1 - r^2) · N(0, sigma)
r = exp(-d_moved / d_corr)
```

| Parameter | LOS | NLOS | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sigma` | 6.0 dB | 8.93 dB | 3GPP TR 38.901 Table 7.5-6 InH-Office |
| `d_corr` | 10 m | 10 m | 3GPP TR 38.901 Table 7.6.3.1-2 InH |

### Fast Fading

| Condition | Model | K-factor | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| LOS | Rician | 7 dB | 3GPP TR 38.901 Table 7.5-6 UMa-LOS |
| NLOS | Rayleigh | - | No dominant path component |

### RSRQ

```
RSRQ (dB) = RSRP - RSSI
```

Where `RSSI` = sum of signals from all detected BSs + thermal noise.

### Thermal Noise Floor

```
noise (dBm) = -174 + 10·log10(bandwidth_hz) + noise_figure_db
```

| Parameter | LTE | NR |
|---|---|---|
| Bandwidth | 20 MHz | 100 MHz |
| Noise figure | 7 dB | 7 dB |
| Noise floor | ~-100 dBm | ~-87 dBm |

---

## Signal Quality Reference

### RSRP
| Value | Quality |
|---|---|
| > -60 dBm | Excellent |
| -60 to -80 dBm | Good |
| -80 to -90 dBm | Medium |
| -90 to -100 dBm | Poor |
| < -100 dBm | Very bad |

### RSRQ
| Value | Quality |
|---|---|
| > -3 dB | Excellent |
| -3 to -10 dB | Good |
| -10 to -15 dB | Medium |
| < -20 dB | Poor |

---

## Handover Logic

Implements the **3GPP A3 event**: a handover is triggered when:

```
RSRP(neighbor) > RSRP(serving) + hysteresis
```

- Default hysteresis: **2 dB**
- Time-to-Trigger (TTT): **320 ms** — condition must hold for the last 320 ms of reports
- Initial connection: UE automatically attaches to the strongest available tower
- Decisions are evaluated at every simulation timestep

### Radio Link Failure (RLF) Detection

A simplified RSRP-based proxy for the 3GPP Qout mechanism. In the standard (TS 38.133 Section 8.1.1 for NR, TS 36.133 Section 7.6 for LTE), Qout is defined as 10% BLER of a hypothetical PDCCH — an SINR/BLER threshold, not RSRP. This simulator uses a per-RAT normalized RSRP threshold mapped to approximately **-116 dBm** as a practical cell-edge proxy:

| RAT | Normalized Threshold | RSRP Equivalent |
|---|---|---|
| NR | `41/127 ≈ 0.323` | ≈ -116 dBm |
| LTE | `25/97 ≈ 0.258` | ≈ -116 dBm |

When the serving cell RSRP falls below the threshold at any timestep, the UE's RLF counter increments by 1.

### Handover Interruption Time (DHO)

Each handover adds a fixed interruption delay to the UE's accumulated handover delay cost (`dho_time`), based on 3GPP intra-frequency known-cell requirements:

| RAT | Interruption Time | Source |
|---|---|---|
| NR | 20 ms | TS 38.133 Section 8.2.2 |
| LTE | 40 ms | TS 36.133 Section 8.1.1.1 |

### Handover Algorithms

| Algorithm | Status | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `A3_RSRP_3GPP` | Implemented | Standard 3GPP A3 event with hysteresis and TTT |
| `DDQN_CHO` | Implemented | Deep Double Q-Network with A2 gate (evaluates only when serving RSRP < -80 dBm) |
| `NONE` | — | No handover (stay on initial tower) |

---

## Reinforcement Learning

The project includes a full DDQN training pipeline for learned handover optimization:

- **QNetwork** (`data_models/q_network.py`) — PyTorch `nn.Module` (14 → 256 → 128 → 64 → 4) with GELU activations, hard target-network update, and `from_state_dict` factory
- **Gymnasium Environment** (`rl/handover_env.py`) — action space: choose 1 of top-4 base stations; observation: 4 normalized RSRP + 4 normalized RSRQ + 4 serving one-hot + 1 normalized speed + 1 normalized time since last handover = 14 features
- **DDQN Agent** (`rl/ddqn_agent.py`) — Double DQN with experience replay, epsilon-greedy exploration, target network hard updates, and GPU support
- **Replay Buffer** (`rl/replay_buffer.py`) — persistent experience replay with disk save/load
- **Checkpoint Manager** (`rl/checkpoint_manager.py`) — saves/resumes training state (epoch, epsilon, networks, optimizer) with cross-device support
- **Top-k Filtering** (`helpers/filters.py`) — selects the k best candidate towers by weighted RSRP/RSRQ score for the observation space
- **Helper Functions** (`helpers/functions.py`) — softmax, cosine similarity, bearing calculation, and weighted sum used by the DDQN handover logic
- **TensorBoard Logger** (`utils/logger.py`) — tracks per-UE metrics (RSRP, RSRQ, handovers, ping-pongs) and system-level metrics (averages, totals, ping-pong rate), plus training metrics (reward, loss, Q-values, epsilon)

### Reward Design

The reward uses a **counterfactual delta** framework — signals from the old and new tower are compared at the same physical position using the latest measurement report:

| Scenario | Reward |
|---|---|
| Handover executed | `rsrp(new_tower) - rsrp(old_tower) + rsrq(new_tower) - rsrq(old_tower) - dynamic_penalty` |
| Stay (no handover) | `0.0` |

The agent is only rewarded/penalized for handover decisions. Staying incurs no cost, so the agent only switches when the signal improvement exceeds the handover penalty. This acts as a learned hysteresis, reducing unnecessary ping-pong handovers.

#### Dynamic Handover Penalty (Cooldown)

The handover penalty scales based on time since the last handover, penalizing rapid switching more heavily:

```
penalty = base_penalty + cooldown_penalty * (1 - time_since_ho / min_time_of_stay)
```

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `base_penalty` | `0.2` | Minimum penalty for any handover |
| `cooldown_penalty` | `0.3` | Additional penalty that decays with time |
| `min_time_of_stay` | `2.5 s` | Cooldown period before penalty returns to base |

This produces a penalty range of `0.2` (cooled down) to `0.5` (immediate re-switch), directly discouraging ping-pong handovers while allowing justified handovers after the cooldown.

## System-Level Abstraction Notes

This simulation is a **system-level abstraction** of the 5G NR physical layer, not a full PHY emulator. Key simplifying assumptions:

| Aspect | 3GPP Reality | Our Abstraction | Justification |
|---|---|---|---|
| **LOS/NLOS** | Probability function based on distance | Hard 5 m cutoff | Simulates dense urban canyon where UEs are almost always NLOS |
| **Antennas** | Massive MIMO with active beamforming | Static isotropic gain (`G_tx`) | Isolates handover algorithm evaluation from beam-tracking mechanics |
| **Path Loss** | Dual-slope model with breakpoint distances | Standard log-distance model | Widely accepted balance of realism and computational efficiency for RL |
| **RLF detection** | SINR/BLER-based Qout with T310/N310/N311 timers | Single RSRP threshold per-RAT (≈ -116 dBm) | Captures cell-edge failure events without full L1/RRC timer state machine |
| **Handover delay** | Variable interruption (search, SI acquisition, RACH) | Fixed per-RAT (NR: 20 ms, LTE: 40 ms) | Matches 3GPP intra-freq known-cell baseline from TS 38.133/36.133 |
