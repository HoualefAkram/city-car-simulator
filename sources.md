## System-Level Abstraction Notes

This simulation is a **system-level abstraction** of the 5G NR physical layer, not a full PHY emulator. The following simplifying assumptions were made:

### 1. LOS/NLOS Hard Cutoff (`__los_threshold = 5`)

**3GPP Reality:** In 3GPP TR 38.901, Line-of-Sight (LOS) is a probability function based on distance (e.g., at 18 meters, there is a 100% chance of LOS; at 100 meters, it drops to ~20%).

**Our Abstraction:** A hard 5-meter cutoff was applied.

**Justification:** To simulate a highly dense Urban Canyon environment where vehicles are almost perpetually in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) conditions relative to macro-cells, a strict LOS threshold of 5 meters was applied.

### 2. Omnidirectional Antennas vs. Beamforming

**3GPP Reality:** 5G NR uses Massive MIMO and active beamforming to track UEs.

**Our Abstraction:** The `G_tx` parameter acts as a static isotropic (omnidirectional) gain.

**Justification:** Antenna radiation patterns were modeled isotropically, with complex beamforming gains abstracted into a constant $G_{tx}$ to isolate the evaluation of the handover algorithm from beam-tracking mechanics.

### 3. Standard Log-Distance Path Loss

**3GPP Reality:** Full 3GPP models use dual-slope path loss with specific breakpoint distances.

**Our Abstraction:** The standard log-distance path loss model was used.

**Justification:** Large-scale path loss was computed using the standard Log-Distance model, which provides a widely accepted balance of physical realism and computational efficiency necessary for the high-throughput Monte Carlo simulations required by Reinforcement Learning.
